Semantic-Fu

ColdFusion custom tags and components for building Semantic Web applications.

Place the project src folder on your custom tag path in your ColdFusion Server or
application.

You'll also need to have the Jena Semantic Web framework, and optionally the Pellet
reasoner library, on your ColdFusion server Java CLASSPATH. See README-Jena.txt for
tips.
